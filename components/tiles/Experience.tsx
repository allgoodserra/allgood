      Aside from an early childhood education in programming starting with BASIC and moving to C++ and Java, as well as a two-year degree in computer science, my professional experience in web technologies and SQL started with on-the-job self-education in Ruby on Rails during my early twenties. My positions since then have involved primarily back end work in Rails, with significant front end work in AngularJS and React.
