      <h2>As a Collaborator</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I adapt to my environment. I prefer to speak plainly and directly when giving feedback or commenting on my own work, with a slight sense of humor. To be frank, I most enjoy a working culture where I can describe a snippet of code as shit; if I'm talking about my own code, I don't want my fellow collaborators to feel as though they need to assure me that I'm a <q>good programmer,</q> and if I'm talking about someone else's code, I want that person to understand that I'm not commenting on their effort, expertise, or them personally. We've all worked in the sausage factory, we know what it's made of, so I don't think there should be shame in acknowledging that the practical application of computer science in a business setting is not an exact science.

      That being said, I believe encouraging each other is paramount to a successful working relationship, so unless it's one of those days, I'm actually very unlikely to be quite that blunt about someone else's work, only my own. When working with more junior developers, I prefer to ask them questions instead of give them advice. Being self-taught in Ruby, I truly believe There's More Then One Way.

      I have an exceptionally low tolerance for working relationships based on making fun of people's quirks and flaws. That is a kind of masculinity I despise. If that is the predominant culture, then I will simply be a coworker, not a friend, and will give every excuse I can to avoid out of work functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I historically have a very bad habit of over committing and taking on every opportunity to help at my own expense. It's a flaw I'm working on.
