        Aside from an early childhood education in basic programming starting with BASIC and moving to C++ and Java, as well as a two year degree in computer science, my professional experience in web technologies and SQL started with self-education in Ruby on Rails seven years ago. My positions since then have involved primarily back end work in Rails, with significant front end work in AngularJS and React.

        During my short tenure at Procore Technologies, I had the privilege to attend two Practical Object Oriented Design workshops given by Sandi Metz, the second of which had only been taught anywhere a handful of times previous. I such advocate for intentional refactoring, common sense testing techniques, and first designing systems without regard to implementation details.

      In my freetime, I enjoy learning and practicing with languages such as Elixir, Elm, Rust, and Golang. I have also made a few contributions to projects in the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://matrix.org'>Matrix Protocol</a> ecosystem.
