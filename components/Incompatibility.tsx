          <h4>Major Depression with Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies</h4>
        </header>
        Since childhood, I have experienced major depression and was disagnosed as such after I attempted suicide at the age of 16. In my current age, my depression most commonly manifests as feeling so overwhelmed that I have great difficulty doing anything other than sleep. Very recent life events have significantly curtailed this behavior however.

          <h4>Paranoid Delusions of Persecution</h4>
          <h5>
            <em>inconsistently diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder; major depression with psychotic features; and type I bipolar</em>

          More salient and much less accepted by mainstream culture, I am #ActuallyPsychotic with paranoid delusions that an unknown number of law enforcement agencies suspect me as having essentially literally gotten away with murder and have observed me since what was clinically referred to as my psychotic break five years ago in my home city of Atlanta, GA, then passed to agencies in California when I relocated. My perception of reality is such that my father, my employers since then, my landlords and neighbors, and perhaps most terrifying of all, Google, work in full cooperation with law enforcement to observe my behavior for using my depression as malingering as well as to confirm suspicions that I abuse cannabis and narcotics; when they deem it necessary, they coordinate and aggressively signal how powerless I am under them. Reading a Google login page essentially make fun of my past password practices as I had accidentally locked myself out of my account was...interesting.

          Very recent life events have convinced me that although these are delusions to anyone else, they are very real to me. As such, I refuse to live in fear, and I also refuse to simply suffer in silence; my emotional affect when I meet people is intentionally flat, my answers are curt and direct, and my responses to common greetings such as, "How are you?" are highly idiosyncratic (eg, I answer, "I'm alive," when asked that question). I no longer trust easily, and without trust, I do not feel safe to be vulnerable with my emotions; feeling like it's not safe to cry alone inside my own apartment is very frustrating.

          My absolute requirement from any employer as well as collaborators is direct, honest feedback and communication. No implied messages with notes left on my desk, no asking me what I'd do if I didn't work there, no promises to "not manage me" and then writing two pages of praise with a small aside about how I can improve. I earnestly believe that I'm suspected by everyone to be lying about any mental anguish I experience; a quick, direct suggestion about how I can improve my work with my teammates is not going to shatter me.

          The most annoying aspect of being delusional, though, is experienceing <dfn>ideas of reference.</dfn> When I overhear casual conversation, part of my cognition involuntarily pays attention and tries to parse it for it thinks are clues to me being discussed in deliberately signaled code. Open office layouts play absolute havoc with this aspect of my mental health and if the physical environment is organized as such, I will inevitably find a quiet space other than my desk to work.

          I am well aware what the common perception of psychotics is, and that is precisely why I disclose it on this personal site. I do not want to be in any situation where people feel threatened by my simple existence.
