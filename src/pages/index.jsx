              If you want to be right, you have to be willing to change your mind and do so frequently.
            </TextEmphasis>
            Software development does not exist in a vacuum, and what you might cherish as a thoughtful and well
            designed approach can always be made better by asking others what their opinions are.

            <TextEmphasis>You're both the imposter and the hero.</TextEmphasis>
            The two most common fallacies that strike software engineers are two sides of the same coin. Instead of
            despairing that you don't deserve to be where you are, hold the acknowledgment that you don't know
            everything, so at every resting point, you can ask yourself honestly, how can I do this better? What
            assumptions am I making? Instead of taking on more than you can handle and refuse to ask for help in an
            attempt to be the hero, be the hero in the sense that you're always willing to take something on that you
            know will challenge you.

            There's no shame at throwing code at a problem to get an idea of how you want to approach it, then deleting
            it all and restarting with best practices in mind.

            Although I keep getting better at minimizing the impact, there are days when I can't do much of anything. I

            Thankfully very manageable, these tend to only crop up when I feel like I'm doing something I'm not supposed
            to or in new chaotic social situation. When I have moments that I can't control it, I may need to abruptly
            and without explanation remove myself from the social situation to calm down.

          <AboutSub>
            Very happily employed at Procore Technologies, I bring a perspective informed by cognitive psychology,
            leftist politics, and an intellectual curiosity so driving that I have to consciously keep myself focused on
            what I'm currently learning.
          </AboutSub>
        </AboutHero>
        <AboutDesc>
          Always praised as a smart child, I'm not afraid to ask ignorant questions and will do so frequently. I deal
          with my mental issues by being transparent, straightforward, and eager, and those attitudes stay with me in
          almost all contexts. My primary motivation is company culture followed closely by the opportunity to try new
          technologies. Interested in hearing what it's like as a software engineer at Procore? I'll be happy to tell
          you great it is here.
